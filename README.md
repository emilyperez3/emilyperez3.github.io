Personal website and portfolio for MAT 189.
I'm a digital storyteller, designer, and Communication major at UC Santa Barbara. As a first-generation college student from a Latinx background, I’ve always been passionate about using creativity to uplift underrepresented voices. Whether it’s through graphic design, photography, video, or social media, I see content as a tool for connection, expression, and change.

I’ve worked with brands like Doritos, Bumble, and Joyba as a student ambassador, creating fun and engaging content while staying grounded in my community. I also work as a social media intern for the UCSB Library and the CalFresh Healthy Living Program, where I help students access important resources through digital outreach and campaigns.

My projects often explore themes of identity, culture, resilience, and memory. I care deeply about storytelling that feels real and personal, especially when it can create space for others to feel seen. From running community events to designing visuals that highlight student voices, my work is always driven by purpose and passion.

In the future, I hope to keep working in spaces where culture and communication meet, especially in advertising, media, or entertainment. I’m always looking for new ways to grow as a creator and continue sharing stories that matter.
