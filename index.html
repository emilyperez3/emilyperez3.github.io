    <p>
      I'm a digital storyteller, designer, and Communication major at UC Santa Barbara. As a first-generation college student from a Latinx background, I’ve always been passionate about using creativity to uplift underrepresented voices. Whether it’s through graphic design, photography, video, or social media, I see content as a tool for connection, expression, and change.

      I’ve worked with brands like Doritos, Bumble, and Joyba as a student ambassador, creating fun and engaging content while staying grounded in my community. I also work as a social media intern for the UCSB Library and the CalFresh Healthy Living Program, where I help students access important resources through digital outreach and campaigns.

      My projects often explore themes of identity, culture, resilience, and memory. I care deeply about storytelling that feels real and personal, especially when it can create space for others to feel seen.

      In the future, I hope to keep working in spaces where culture and communication meet, especially in advertising, media, or entertainment. I’m always looking for new ways to grow as a creator and continue sharing stories that matter.
