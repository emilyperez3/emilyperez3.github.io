    <h1>Emily Perez</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a Communication student at UCSB passionate about media, culture, and storytelling. 
      I create content that blends design and emotion, often drawing from personal and community experiences. 
      As a first-generation college student, I value creative expression as a form of empowerment and representation.
